    text to graphics image generation routine.
    Given a string, it should produce a buffer
    that holds the graphical image of the ASCII characters in a string.
    height of the buffer is fixed.

    either:
    a)figure out how much text fits on the status bar and produce a buffer of fixed size
    b)return the resulting image width

    in either case:
    the test must be centered on the bar

    Basically were drawing this thing in the buffer?
    //put in one of two colors (color 1 or color 2)
    //depending on which bit of holder we're on
